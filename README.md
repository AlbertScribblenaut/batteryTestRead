# batteryTestRead
Code related to digesting and graphing data via BTSDA battery testing software. Coded in MATLAB.

You may be wondering why most of the code has already been mostly written so quickly since the initial commit. When the code was initially written for printed batteries research, it was synced by Google Backup and Sync locally to Google Drive in late August 2019. Unfortunately, Google Drive doesn't serve as a very good VCS, which is why the code has been moved to GitHub, but there is no track record of all the different things that were attempted to get the code to work. All the previous versions of this code are lost somewhere else, but at least the code that is here is the working kind.

The programming knowledge required for making this code read test data in spreadsheets required functional programming knowledge and an understanding of cell arrays in MATLAB. If you can't run it, that's probably because you don't want to pay an expensive license for it, which is understandable.

Why MATLAB? Because this research has been using it for creating graphs manually (as in, going into the Excel spreadsheet and telling MATLAB to graph several ranges of cells) from before I joined the project.

Hope this answers most of the questions you have about the code!
